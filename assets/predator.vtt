227
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.740
&nbsp;

228
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.440

&nbsp;

236
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.259

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:53.400
crew and prey was maybe not so familiar

243
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.400
&nbsp;

244
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.139
to the audience but they surely were

245
00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:55.139
&nbsp;

246
00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:57.880
aware of the burden they had to carry

247
00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.880
&nbsp;

248
00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.919
for this kind of movie franchise the

&nbsp;

260
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.460
who became known to the audience from

261
00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.460
&nbsp;

262
00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.919
the movie sui played fellow Comanche

263
00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:14.919
&nbsp;

264
00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.620
Warrior Wasabi we also saw the musician

265
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.620

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.639
chief wife Sumo we know that the

271
00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:24.639
&nbsp;

272
00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:26.390
Predator killed Wasabi and the war chief

273
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.390
&nbsp;

274
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.500
tabi so they probably won't come back to

275
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:29.500
&nbsp;

276
00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.300
reprise their roles a lot of other

277
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.300
&nbsp;

278
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.220
Comanche warriors were killed in the

&nbsp;

280
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.139
fight with the mighty creature we can't

281
00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:34.139
&nbsp;

282
00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:36.180
be sure who is and who is not coming

283
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.180
&nbsp;

284
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.639
back to reprise their role but it's sure

285
00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:39.639
&nbsp;

286
00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:41.560
that now is the right time for you to

287
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.560

&nbsp;

292
00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:47.100
really it's almost sure that we will see

293
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.100
&nbsp;

294
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.390
some new faces if the sequel of prey is

295
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.390
&nbsp;

296
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.800
going to happen there are a lot of

297
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.800
&nbsp;

298
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.600
Native American actors that could join

299
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.600
&nbsp;

300
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.160
the cast if the movie stays in the same

301
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:56.160
&nbsp;

302
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.160
period last but not least let's see what

303
00:05:59.160 --> 00:05:59.160
&nbsp;

304
00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.900
we can expect from the story in the

305
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:01.900
&nbsp;

306
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.300
potential sixth film The Predator films

307
00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:03.300
&nbsp;

308
00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.220
had some strange Journey since the

310
00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.320
original was released with many rotating

311
00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.320
&nbsp;

312
00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.600
protagonists said settings and enemies

313
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.600
&nbsp;

314
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.460
the last movie was another one in the

315
00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:11.460
&nbsp;

316
00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.840
sequence of these twists in the

317
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:13.840
&nbsp;

318
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.000

Predator movies John Davis who has been

321
00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:17.340
&nbsp;

322
00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.800
involved in the franchise since the

323
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.800
&nbsp;

324
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.780
first movie in 1987. recently for

325
00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:22.780
&nbsp;

326
00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.240
variety commented on the success of prey

327
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.240
&nbsp;

328
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.860
and he also commented on the

329
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:26.860
&nbsp;

330
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.660
possibilities for future adaptations

331
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:28.660
&nbsp;

332
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.819
Davis said that the creatures could

333
00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:30.819
&nbsp;

334
00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:32.460
appear in every period Well maybe

335
00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:32.460
&nbsp;

336
00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.800
there's an origin story right maybe

337
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.800
&nbsp;

338
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.900
there's another Alien vs Predator story

339
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:37.900
&nbsp;

340
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.880
in a different situation and maybe

341
00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:39.880
&nbsp;

342
00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.100
there's a new modern day version and

343
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.100
&nbsp;

344
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.780
maybe there's something somewhere in

345
00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:43.780
&nbsp;

346
00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.600
between I think this character can show

347
00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:45.600
&nbsp;

348
00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.520
up throughout history he said on the

349
00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:48.520
&nbsp;

350
00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.800
other side director tritenberg more

351
00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:50.800
&nbsp;

352
00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.960
precisely a seat that he is open to the

353
00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:52.960
&nbsp;

354
00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.419
idea of a new movie in an interview with

355
00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:54.419
&nbsp;

356
00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:57.600
time out he said there are a lot of

357
00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:57.600
&nbsp;

358
00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.280
exciting ideas for what could be for the

359
00:06:59.280 --> 00:06:59.280
&nbsp;

360
00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.200
next franchise the things that most

361
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:01.200
&nbsp;

362
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.720
excite me are the bodus wings and I

363
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:04.720
&nbsp;

364
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.340
think there's scope to do other things

365
00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:05.340
&nbsp;

366
00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.500
that haven't been done before if you

367
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:08.500
&nbsp;

368
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.780
analyze these comments you will conclude

369
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:10.780
&nbsp;

370
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.580
that it seems the Predator franchise

371
00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:12.580
&nbsp;

372
00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.400
will continue in some other ambient in

373
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:14.400
&nbsp;

374
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.500
some other period but still the end

375
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:17.500
&nbsp;

376
00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.840
credits of prey suggest that the Saga

377
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:19.840
&nbsp;

378
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.000
will continue with a sequel at the end

379
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:21.000
&nbsp;

380
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.160
of the movie the young Warrior girl will

381
00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:23.160
&nbsp;

382
00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.259
use the Predator's technology to kill

383
00:07:25.259 --> 00:07:25.259
&nbsp;

384
00:07:25.259 --> 00:07:27.479
the creature she will return to her

385
00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:27.479
&nbsp;

386
00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:29.400
tribe with a predator's head and will

387
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:29.400
&nbsp;

388
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.500
celebrate with her people but she will

389
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:32.500
&nbsp;

390
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.840
urge them that they must react quickly

391
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:34.840
&nbsp;

392
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.180
because out there is still a threat

393
00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:36.180
&nbsp;

394
00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.919
maybe she thinks about the French

395
00:07:38.919 --> 00:07:38.919
&nbsp;

396
00:07:38.919 --> 00:07:40.199
Trapper she met before and killed some

397
00:07:40.199 --> 00:07:40.199
&nbsp;

398
00:07:40.199 --> 00:07:42.300
of them but we know that this Predator

399
00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:42.300
&nbsp;

400
00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.699
is not the last of its kind as the story

401
00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:45.699
&nbsp;

402
00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:48.819
happens in 1719 and we already know that

403
00:07:48.819 --> 00:07:48.819
&nbsp;

404
00:07:48.819 --> 00:07:50.680
the creatures who are hungry for human

405
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:50.680
&nbsp;

406
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.840
trophies will also show up in modern

407
00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:52.840
&nbsp;

408
00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.960
times so guys stay patient because very

409

411
00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:57.940
&nbsp;

412
00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.919
continue the story and the producers

413
00:07:59.919 --> 00:07:59.919
&nbsp;

414
00:07:59.919 --> 00:08:01.139
will probably wait a few more months to

415
00:08:01.139 --> 00:08:01.139
&nbsp;

416
00:08:01.139 --> 00:08:03.600
analyze the success of their recently

417
